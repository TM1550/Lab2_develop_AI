  In school, children learn to read and write. 
Writing helps us to remember things and to communicate with other people. 
  We can write stories, letters, or lists. To make words on a page, you need a tool. 
You use a pencil or a pen to write on paper. 
  A pencil uses graphite, and a pen uses ink. 
Before there were pens and pencils, people used feathers or brushes. 
Today, many people also type on computers and phones instead of writing by hand
