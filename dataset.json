    "question": "Which company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne?",
    "answer": "Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.",
    "context": "The late 1970s witnessed the dawn of the personal computer revolution, moving computing power from large, room-sized mainframes to devices that could fit on a desk. This shift was made possible by the invention of the microprocessor. Early pioneers began experimenting with kits and building machines for hobbyists.\nIn 1976, a pivotal company was established in a garage in Los Altos, California. Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Their first product, the Apple I, was a hand-built computer circuit board, far less sophisticated than what would follow.\nThe company's subsequent product, the Apple II, became a massive success and is widely credited with popularizing the home computer. It established Apple as a major player and set the stage for decades of innovation in consumer electronics, fundamentally changing how people interact with technology."

    "question": "What is the main function of chlorophyll in plants?",
    "answer": "The main function of chlorophyll is to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis.",
    "context": "Plants are autotrophic organisms, meaning they produce their own food. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it forms the base of the food chain. Unlike animals, plants do not need to consume other organisms for energy.\nThe key to this energy production is a green pigment found in chloroplasts. The main function of chlorophyll is to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. This captured light energy is then converted into chemical energy, which the plant uses to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water.\nWithout chlorophyll, photosynthesis could not occur, and life as we know it would not be sustainable. This pigment is also responsible for the characteristic green color of most plants, as it absorbs blue and red light but reflects green light."

    "question": "What event is widely considered the beginning of World War II?",
    "answer": "The invasion of Poland is widely considered the beginning of World War II.",
    "context": "The interwar period in Europe was marked by political instability and the rise of totalitarian regimes. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, left Germany with heavy reparations and resentment. This environment allowed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party to gain power in the 1930s.\nThe aggressive expansionist policies of Nazi Germany led to a series of crises. The event widely considered the beginning of World War II was the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. This act prompted Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany two days later.\nThe conflict quickly escalated, eventually involving most of the world's nations and becoming the deadliest war in human history. The war saw the use of new, devastating technologies and culminated in the use of atomic weapons before ending in 1945."

    "question": "What is the largest organ in the human body?",
    "answer": "The skin is the largest organ in the human body.",
    "context": "The human body is a complex system composed of many organs that work together to sustain life. Organs like the heart, liver, and brain each have specialized functions crucial for survival. Understanding human anatomy is fundamental to the fields of medicine and biology.\nSurprisingly, the organ that covers the entire external surface of the body holds this title. The skin is the largest organ in the human body. It serves as a protective barrier against pathogens, regulates body temperature, and allows for the sensation of touch, pressure, and pain.\nThe skin consists of multiple layers, including the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Its health is vital for overall well-being, and it constantly regenerates itself. Proper skincare is important to maintain its protective functions and prevent diseases."

    "context": "Elizabethan England was a golden age for English literature and theatre. The period saw the construction of famous playhouses like The Globe, where audiences from all social classes gathered for entertainment. This environment fostered incredible creative output.\nThe most celebrated playwright of this era, and perhaps of all time, was a man from Stratford-upon-Avon. William Shakespeare wrote the famous play 'Romeo and Juliet'. This tragic tale of two young star-crossed lovers has become synonymous with romantic tragedy.\nFirst performed around the mid-1590s, the play's themes of love, conflict, and fate continue to resonate with modern audiences.

    "question": "What is the primary source of the Sun's energy?",
    "answer": "The primary source of the Sun's energy is nuclear fusion.",
    "context": "The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system and is crucial for life on Earth. It provides the heat and light that make our planet habitable. Understanding how the Sun produces such vast amounts of energy has been a key question in astrophysics.\nThe process that powers the Sun is the same as that which occurs in a hydrogen bomb. The primary source of the Sun's energy is nuclear fusion. In its core, extreme pressure and temperature cause hydrogen nuclei to fuse together, forming helium and releasing tremendous energy in the process.\nThis energy travels outward from the core through radiation and convection zones, eventually reaching the surface and radiating into space as sunlight. It takes thousands of years for energy generated in the core to reach the Sun's surface."

    "question": "In which country would you find the ancient monument Stonehenge?",
    "answer": "You would find Stonehenge in England.",
    "context": "Prehistoric Europe is home to many mysterious monuments constructed by Neolithic peoples. These structures, often built from massive stones, provide clues about the beliefs, astronomy, and engineering skills of ancient civilizations. Their exact purposes are still debated by archaeologists.\nOne of the most famous and enigmatic of these sites is located on Salisbury Plain. You would find Stonehenge in England. This ring of standing stones, each around 13 feet high, is believed to have been constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC.\nThe alignment of the stones with the sunrise at the summer solstice suggests it was used as an astronomical observatory or a religious site connected to the sun. It remains a place of pilgrimage for modern pagans and a site of wonder for tourists from around the world."

    "question": "What gas do plants release during photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis.",
    "context": "Photosynthesis is a biochemical process that is fundamental to life on our planet. It is how plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's activities. This process primarily requires water, carbon dioxide, and light.\nWhile plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they release a different gas as a byproduct. Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis. This oxygen is released into the atmosphere through small pores in the leaves called stomata.\nThe oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms over billions of years is responsible for the Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere, which allowed for the evolution of complex, oxygen-breathing life forms like animals. This makes photosynthesis one of the most important biological processes."
